# Bears Event Finder

Bears event finder makes finding live music a breeze - whether at home or on the road.

Combing through concert listings of unfamiliar bands, searching out their Spotify/Youtube pages to preview their sound and, if you're interested, finding your way back to buy tickets and get venue information is tedious and time-consuming. BTE let's you do all of this through a single beautiful and intuitive application. 

Begin by simply entering 1 (or more) destinations in combination with your arrival/departure dates and your favorite genres. BTE will search the area and return a playlist for each city where you can preview each band, see where they're playing at and find tickets.

Once connected to Spotify, you can save each city playlist to your profile. There, you can listen to a band's full catalogue and send a song or five to your friends (along with the ticket link!).

We are a one of the Tier-3 Bears teams in Voyage-5, hosted by the [Chingu](chingu.io) Organization.

Our purpose here at Bears-11 is to learn and improve in web development through building a web application while working in a remote development team collaboratively and asynchronously.
